# Firmware Update

In order to help you in installing and configuring the Firmware, please take a look at the [Wiki](https://github.com/Dtcreation/Firmware-Molise-Artillery/wiki)

First, you need to install / update TFT Firmware, and after that you will update Marlin with Molise version.

## TFT Firmware Update

<a name="TFT-Firmware-Installation"></a>

### TFT Firmware Installation

In order to install the TFT firmware:

1. Download the firmware
2. Unzip the archive and copy the contents to the SD Card. The folder `TFT28` and file `MKSTFT28.bin` must be on the root folder of the SD card
3. Plug in the SD card into the printer
4. Turn on the printer and wait for the firmware to finish flashing
5. In case calibration procedure is started, touch the calibration points on the screen
6. Restart the printer
7. Proceed with the configuration as reported on section [TFT Firmware Configuration](#TFT-Firmware-Configuration)

IMPORTANT NOTE: Always install all the content provided in the zip file. That means, copy in the SD card the .bin + config.ini + TFT28 folder with its files. In addition (optional) also the desired language_xx.ini file can be provided in the root folder of the SD card. All the language files are found in the Language_Packs folder.

<a name="TFT-Firmware-Configuration"></a>

### TFT Firmware Configuration

To update the TFT firmware configuration:

1. Edit the settings in `config.ini`. See the comments on the file to properly set each setting
2. Copy the `config.ini` file to the root folder of the SD card. (The SD card capacity should be less than or equal to 8GB and formatted as FAT32)
3. Insert the SD card in the TFT's SD card slot and restart the TFT by pressing the reset button (if you have a Sidewinder X1 v4 or above printer revision) or switching off and on the printer
4. The TFT will load the configuration from `config.ini` file and store it on internal SPI flash. That means the configuration will be loaded from SPI flash on all the next printer reboots (no need to provide the configuration file on the SD card unless you make changes on `config.ini` file and want to load the new configuration)


<a name="TFT-Firmware-Not-Attached"></a>

### TFT Firmware Not Attached

If the text:

    No printer attached!

is displayed on top of the display it means you need to change the value for the **UART speed** setting. By default it is set to **250000**. Change it from TFT menu **Menu->Settings->Connection->S. Ports**, wait few seconds in order to check that with the selected UART speed the error message disappears. Once the message disappears it means that the TFT firmware is now connected to the printer and you can use it.

<a name="TFT-Firmware-Rollback"></a>

### TFT Firmware Rollback

In case you have issues with this custom firmware or you don't like it, you can rollback to the firmware previously installed in your printer.

In order to rollback:

1. Download the stock Artillery TFT firmware (from https://artillery3d.com) or any other custom TFT firmware you had previously installed in your printer
2. Unzip the archive and copy the contents to the SD Card. The contents must be on the root folder of the SD card
3. Plug in the SD card into the printer
4. Turn on the printer and wait for the firmware to finish flashing
5. Restart the printer

### About TFT Screen Firmware

The Molise Firmware is supplied with a second firmware, this is the firmware of the TFT screen. This TFT Firmware is based on the Official Firmware of Bigtreetech with the support among others of the following touch functions:

- M600
- Babystepping
- ABL
- MBL
- Z Offset
- Autotune PID
- Assisted filament loading-unloading
- Assisted E-step calibration
- UART management
- Various configurations

## Marlin - Install / Update Molise

On Sidewinder X1 and Genius printers, the mainboard's USB port used to connect the printer to a PC (e.g. to OctoPrint) is wired to a serial bus. This bus is also shared by both TFT and mainboard. The sharing of the serial bus does not allow to easily flash Marlin firmware due to collisions in the bus.

Two possible solutions were normally adopted to allow Marlin firmware updates:

1. Physical disconnection of the TFT serial cable so the serial bus is no more shared with the TFT. This solution requires to remove the cover under the chassis and possibly to loose any warrenty
2. Use a script under Linux OS trying to lock the serial bus to the TFT

This TFT firmware provides a third, and easy to use, solution for flashing Marlin firmware.

In order to flash Marlin firmware, follow the steps below in the same order they are reported:

1. Switch on the printer from the main power button (on the back of the printer)
2. From the TFT, press on button **Menu->Settings->Connection->Disconnect**. A black background with a text asking to touch the screen to connect again the TFT is prompted. **DO NOT** press on the display, so the TFT will continue to be disconnected from the serial bus
3. From the PC, open the application you usually use for flashing Marlin firmware (e.g. PrusaSlicer)
4. Plug a USB cable from the PC to the mainboard's USB port and connect the application to the printer
5. Follow the instructions provided by your application to flash Marlin firmware
6. Once Marlin firmware is flashed, disconnect the application from the printer and restart the printer (switching off and on or pressing on the TFT's reset button if you have a Sidewinder X1 v4)

#### Marlin Firmware Configuration

After a new Marlin firmware is installed (see section [Marlin Firmware Installation](#Marlin-Firmware-Installation)), EEPROM must always be reset and the following setups have to be performed again and saved to EEPROM after completion:

1. Reset EEPROM, from **Menu->Settings->Machine->EEPROM->Reset** button
2. Perform **PID** process, from **Menu->Settings->Machine->Tuning->PID** menu
3. Perform **Probe Offset** process (only for BLTouch Marlin firmware versions), from **Menu->Movement->Bed Level->P Offset** menu
4. Perform **Bed Leveling** process, from **Menu->Movement->Bed Level->UBL** (or MBL) menu
5. Save to EEPROM, from **Menu->Settings->Machine->EEPROM->Save** button

### Disconnect TFT screen

This solutions have normally been adopted to allow Marlin firmware updates with a prerequisite, disconnecting the black and red cable from the TFT screen (definitely, this cable is mainly used to block the flash):

Physical disconnection of the TFT serial cable so that the serial bus is no longer shared with the TFT. This solution requires removing the cover under the chassis and possibly losing all warranty.

See image below, and disconnect TFT1 (original connection)

### Change the port of the TFT on the mainboard to avoid conflict with Octoprint

When you use Octoprint with a custom firmware, you have a conflict with the TFT display. On Sidewinder X1 and Genius printers, the mainboard's USB port used to connect the printer to a PC (e.g. to Octoprint) is wired to a serial bus. This bus is also shared by both TFT and mainboard. To install a new firmware, you need to disconnect the TFT by opening the printer each time. So you can change the port of the TFT on another slot of the mainboard MKS to avoid any conflict in the future.

- Deport the TFT connection to the EXP1 port, you can then flash without any worries

# How to build

## VSCode

The simplest way to build is to switch the PlatformIO project environment in VSCode (as the screenshot below) and use one of the presets:

![Platform IO env](screenshots/switch_env.png)

- For the Sidewinder X1:
  - __env:x1_mbl__: with Mesh Bed Leveling
  - __env:x1_bltouch__: with BL Touch
  - __env:x1_touchmi__: with Touch Mi
- For the Genius:
  - __env:genius_mbl__: with Mesh Bed Leveling
  - __env:genius_bltouch__: with BL Touch
  - __env:genius_touchmi__: with Touch Mi
- For the Sidewinder X2: __env:x2__
- For the Genius Pro: __env:geniuspro__
- For the Hornet: __env:hornet__

If you're using VSCode extension for PlatformIO, you should be able to pick the environment you want directly from the bottom bar.

If you need more fined-grained configuration (e.g. custom board or custom extruder), you may stay on the default PlatformIO environment and follow through the instructions in [Marlin/Configuration.h](Marlin/Configuration.h). To build custom Molise Firmware, replace "CHANGE_VALUE" in [platformio.ini](platformio.ini) with the required configuration, save file and change platform.io env to `default`

![platform.ini CHANGE_VALUE](screenshots/platform.io-change_value.png)

![Platform.ini env:default](screenshots/switch_env_custom.png)

The code in the `Configuration.h` file has been split into 7 sections to make the code more readable. So, for people who want to compile code from source, the job will be easier. For more explanation on the code compilation, please refer to the [dedicated wiki](https://github.com/Dtcreation/Firmware-Molise-Artillery/wiki)

## PIO Command Line Interface

You can also build from `pio` command line directly, for instance:

> pio run -e x1_mbl
