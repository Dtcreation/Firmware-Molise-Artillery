The code in the `Configuration.h` file has been split into 7 sections to make the code more readable. So, for people who want to compile code from source, the job will be easier. For more explanation on the code compilation, please refer to the [dedicated wiki](https://github.com/Dtcreation/Firmware-Molise-Artillery/wiki)

Molise firmware is provided to you free of charge in an "as is" state. We cannot be held responsible for any damage it may do to your 3D printer if it occurs. Please proceed with caution.

#### TFT Screen Firmware

The Molise Firmware is supplied with a second firmware, this is the firmware of the TFT screen. This TFT Firmware is based on the Official Firmware of Bigtreetech with the support among others of the following touch functions:

- M600
- Babystepping
- ABL
- MBL
- Z Offset
- Autotune PID
- Assisted filament loading-unloading
- Assisted E-step calibration
- UART management
- Various configurations

And all preconfigured in French and English

### Installation and configuration

In order to help you in installing and configuring the Firmware, please take a look at the [Wiki](https://github.com/Dtcreation/Firmware-Molise-Artillery/wiki)

### Update Molise

On the Sidewinder X1 and Genius printers, the USB port on the motherboard used to connect the printer to a PC (e.g. Octoprint) is wired to a serial bus. This bus is also shared by the TFT and the motherboard. Sharing the serial bus does not allow easy flashing of Marlin firmware due to collisions in the bus.

Three possible solutions have normally been adopted to allow Marlin firmware updates with a prerequisite, disconnecting the black and red cable from the TFT screen (definitely, this cable is mainly used to block the flash):

1) physical disconnection of the TFT serial cable so that the serial bus is no longer shared with the TFT. This solution requires removing the cover under the chassis and possibly losing all warranty.

2) Turn on the printer from the main power button (on the back of the printer)
from the TFT, press the "Menu-> Parameters-> Connection-> Disconnect" button. A black background with text asking to touch the screen to reconnect the TFT is prompted. DO NOT press the screen to keep the TFT disconnected from the serial bus.
from the PC, open the application you usually use to flash the Marlin firmware.
connect a USB cable from the PC to the USB port on the motherboard and connect the application to the printer
follow the instructions provided by your application to flash the Marlin firmware.
After the Marlin firmware is flashed, disconnect the application from the printer and restart the printer.

3) deport the TFT connection to the EXP1 port, you can then flash without any worries
